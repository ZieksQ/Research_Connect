## ⚙ Concept

The project is a web and mobile app that serves as a platform for users to post and share surveys related to their Thesis, Capstone, or Research projects. Its purpose is to help students and researchers easily gather participants for their surveys while also allowing others to discover and support these studies. The problem it aims to solve is the difficulty students often face in reaching enough respondents for their academic research.

**User Profiles** – Users may create a profile with their program and research focus for added credibility and personalization.
